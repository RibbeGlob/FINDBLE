# **ESP32 Mesh Tracking System**

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a **wireless mesh network** of **ESP32-C3** modules communicating with a **central Raspberry Pi unit (RPI)**. The ESP32 nodes will track the signal of registered devices and transmit relevant parameters to the Raspberry Pi, which will generate a **spatial map** and provide real-time **coordinates of tracked devices**.

## 🚀 **Project Goals**
- Establish a **mesh network** of ESP32-C3 nodes for robust wireless communication.
- Implement **real-time tracking** of specific devices using signal strength and positioning algorithms.
- Send collected data from ESP32 nodes to the **Raspberry Pi** over an optimized communication protocol.
- Develop a **spatial mapping system** on the Raspberry Pi to visualize the location of tracked devices.
- Ensure efficiency and accuracy in tracking while maintaining low-latency communication.

## 🔧 **Technology Stack**
- **ESP32-C3** – Mesh networking, signal tracking, and data transmission.
- **Raspberry Pi** – Data aggregation, spatial mapping, and coordinate calculations.
- **C** – Core firmware development for ESP32-C3.
- **Golang** – Backend processing, data handling, and mapping algorithms on Raspberry Pi.
