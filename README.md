# **ESP32 Mesh Tracking System**

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a **wireless network** of **ESP32-C3** modules communicating with a **central PC**. The ESP32 nodes will track the signal of registered devices and transmit relevant parameters to the PC, which will generate a **spatial map** and provide real-time **coordinates of tracked devices**.

## 🚀 **Project Goals**
- Implement **real-time tracking** of specific devices using signal strength and positioning algorithms.
- Send collected data from ESP32 nodes to the **PC** over an optimized communication protocol.
- Develop a **spatial mapping system** on the PC to visualize the location of tracked devices.
- Ensure efficiency and accuracy in tracking while maintaining low-latency communication.

## 🔧 **Technology Stack**
- **ESP32-C3** – Signal tracking and data transmission.
- **PC** – Data aggregation, spatial mapping, and coordinate calculations.
- **C** – Core firmware development for ESP32-C3.
- **Golang** – Backend processing, data handling, and mapping algorithms on PC.

## 📅 **Project Timeline**
**Start Date:** February 2, 2025  

## 🏗 **Development Phases**
1. **ESP32 Network Setup** – Establishing communication between multiple ESP32 and RPI.
2. **Signal Tracking Implementation** – Developing methods to detect and analyze signal strength.
